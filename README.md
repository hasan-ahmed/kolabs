## Description

Kolabs is a web app where a company can invite users to submit feature requests. Users can upvote features submitted by others and leave comments. The company will have an admin portal where they can view the requests that have been submitte by users and prioritize them based on things such as # of upvotes, # of followers, # of comments. When the company decides to accept the feature request and completes it, the submitter and followers of the feature request will be automatically notified via email that the feature that they have requested have been implemented. Finally, the platform will perform NLP on new requests to categorize them (mandatory feature).
