## Description

Kolabs is a web app where a company can invite users to submit feature requests. Users can upvote features submitted by others and leave comments. The company will have an admin portal where they can view the requests that have been submitte by users and prioritize them based on things such as # of upvotes, # of followers, # of comments. The company can update their progress on implementing the feature request and users can follow the progress.. Finally, the platform will perform NLP on new requests to categorize them (mandatory feature).
